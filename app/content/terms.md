# Terms of Use

_Last updated: October 2025_

Welcome to **Swap2p**, a decentralized peer-to-peer (P2P) exchange interface that allows users to interact directly with immutable smart contracts deployed on public blockchains (such as Mezo).  
By accessing or using the Swap2p website (the “Interface”), you agree to the following Terms of Use (“Terms”). Please read them carefully before using the Interface.

---

## 1. Nature of the Service

Swap2p is a **non-custodial, on-chain marketplace** that enables users to exchange ERC-20 tokens for off-chain fiat through a **double-collateral escrow mechanism**.  
All logic is encoded in open-source, immutable smart contracts.  
Swap2p **does not host servers, store personal data, or maintain custody of any funds**.

The Interface simply displays blockchain data and helps users broadcast transactions to the smart contracts.  
Swap2p is **not a broker, exchange, intermediary, payment processor, or financial institution**.

---

## 2. Acceptance of Terms

By using the Interface, you confirm that you:
- are at least 18 years old;
- understand how blockchain transactions and self-custody wallets operate;
- take full responsibility for your actions, transactions, and compliance with local laws.

If you disagree with these Terms, **do not use** the Interface.

---

## 3. Non-Custodial Disclaimer

- Swap2p never takes control of user funds, private keys, or fiat transfers.
- All trades are executed directly between blockchain addresses through immutable smart contracts.
- Off-chain fiat settlement (e.g. via bank transfer or local payment methods) occurs **outside** of the Swap2p ecosystem, and Swap2p has **no visibility or control** over such transfers.

You acknowledge that Swap2p **cannot reverse, cancel, or mediate** any transactions.

---

## 4. User Responsibility

You are solely responsible for:
- verifying counterparties and payment details before proceeding with trades;
- complying with your local laws, tax regulations, and reporting obligations;
- using secure wallet software and maintaining control of your private keys.

You agree **not to use** Swap2p for any unlawful activity, including but not limited to:
- money laundering, terrorist financing, fraud, or sanctions evasion;
- exchanging assets that are stolen or otherwise illicitly obtained.

---

## 5. No Guarantees or Warranties

The Interface and smart contracts are provided **“as is”** and **“as available”** without warranties of any kind, express or implied.  
Swap2p makes **no guarantees** that:
- trades will be completed successfully;
- counterparties will fulfill fiat obligations;
- the smart contracts will be free from bugs, exploits, or vulnerabilities.

You use the Interface **at your own risk**.

---

## 6. Limitation of Liability

To the maximum extent permitted by law, Swap2p and its contributors shall **not be liable** for any damages or losses, whether direct, indirect, incidental, or consequential, arising from or in connection with:
- your use or inability to use the Interface;
- any transaction between users;
- any failure, delay, or exploit of blockchain networks or smart contracts.

---

## 7. Intellectual Property

The Swap2p name, logo, and related branding are protected by applicable copyright and trademark laws.  
You may not use the Swap2p brand or codebase in a way that implies endorsement or affiliation without written permission.

Open-source components remain subject to their respective licenses.

---

## 8. No Financial Advice

Swap2p does not provide financial, investment, or legal advice.  
All information presented through the Interface or documentation is for **informational and educational purposes only**.  
You are responsible for your own investment decisions.

---

## 9. Modifications to Terms

Because the Interface is decentralized and immutable, its core functionality cannot be changed.  
However, the website and documentation may be updated periodically to clarify legal disclaimers or terminology.  
Continued use after such updates constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.

---

## 10. Governing Law

These Terms shall be governed by general principles of international law applicable to open-source software and blockchain systems.  
In jurisdictions where such a disclaimer is insufficient, users agree to resolve disputes under the laws of a neutral jurisdiction chosen by the Swap2p contributors (e.g., Estonia, Singapore, or BVI).

---

## 11. Contact

As Swap2p is a decentralized open-source project without a central operator, formal support channels do not exist.  
For inquiries or responsible disclosure of security issues, you may contact the contributors via:

**Email:** contact@swap2p.org  
**PGP:** Available upon request.

---

### Summary

Swap2p is a **tool**, not a custodian or exchange.  
By using it, you acknowledge that **you alone control your assets, bear your risks, and must ensure legal compliance in your jurisdiction.**

Use responsibly. Trade peer-to-peer. Stay decentralized.
