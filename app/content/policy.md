# Privacy Policy

_Last updated: October 2025_

This Privacy Policy explains how **Swap2p** (“we”, “our”, or “us”) handles information when you use the Swap2p website (the “Interface”).  
Swap2p is a **fully decentralized, non-custodial, open-source application** that enables peer-to-peer exchange of ERC-20 tokens and fiat using immutable smart contracts.  
We are committed to respecting your privacy and minimizing data collection.

---

## 1. No Personal Data Collection

Swap2p does **not** require registration, identity verification, or creation of an account.  
We do **not** collect, store, or share:
- personal identifiers (name, email, phone, address);
- KYC or financial documents;
- wallet private keys or seed phrases.

Your interaction with Swap2p occurs **entirely on-chain**, through your own self-custodial wallet (e.g., MetaMask, Rainbow, etc.).

---

## 2. On-Chain and Public Data

All transactions performed via Swap2p occur directly on public blockchain networks (such as Mezo).  
The following information is **public by design** and stored permanently on the blockchain:
- wallet addresses;
- token amounts, offers, and escrow states;
- timestamps and transaction hashes.

Swap2p does not have the ability to alter, delete, or conceal on-chain data.

---

## 3. Cookies and Analytics

By default, Swap2p does **not** use cookies, trackers, or analytics tools.  
If in the future analytics are implemented (for example, privacy-preserving metrics like Plausible Analytics), users will be notified, and only **non-personal, aggregated data** will be collected — such as:
- page views;
- browser type;
- approximate region (without IP storage).

We will never use invasive tracking such as Google Analytics, fingerprinting, or third-party advertising pixels.

---

## 4. Third-Party Wallets

When connecting your wallet, you interact directly with the wallet provider’s software.  
Swap2p **does not** receive or store your private keys or wallet credentials.  
Please review your wallet provider’s privacy policy for details on their own data practices.

---

## 5. Communication and Support

Swap2p is an open-source, decentralized project and does not operate centralized support systems.  
If you contact us voluntarily (e.g., via email), your message and address will be used solely to respond to your inquiry and will not be stored beyond what is necessary.

---

## 6. Security

Because Swap2p does not host user data or maintain servers, traditional data breaches are not possible.  
However, users are responsible for securing their own wallets, devices, and private keys.  
Swap2p cannot recover lost assets, passwords, or transactions.

---

## 7. Links to Other Sites

The Interface may contain links to third-party applications, documentation, or wallet providers.  
Swap2p has no control over and is not responsible for the privacy policies or content of such external websites.

---

## 8. Children’s Privacy

Swap2p is not directed toward individuals under 18 years of age.  
We do not knowingly collect personal information from minors.

---

## 9. Changes to This Policy

Because the Interface is decentralized and minimal by design, changes to this Privacy Policy will only occur to clarify language or comply with updated laws.  
Revisions will be posted on this page with an updated “Last updated” date.

---

## 10. Contact

If you have questions, suggestions, or wish to report a security or privacy concern, you may contact the maintainers via:

**Email:** privacy@swap2p.org  
**PGP:** Available upon request.

---

### Summary

Swap2p collects **no personal data**, stores **no information on servers**, and processes all interactions **directly on-chain**.  
Your privacy and custody remain entirely under your own control.
